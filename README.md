# ShowWatchlist

Everybody loves TV Shows. Supernatural, Smallville, The Flash, Desperate Housewives, Gilmore girls and many more. But in these days nobody have a time to think about what to watch next. Or even what to watch next evening. We have so much work, stress and yet no time for fun and joy.

Imagine in this work-to-home-fifty-shades-of-gray lifestyle, when you receive a notification that your favorite show has a new episode. Wouldn't that make your day a little less stressed and a lot more sunny?

If this thought makes you smile and happy, you will fall in love with **Show Watchlist**. With it you can:

- Mark shows what you are currently watching and keep track of the last episode of your favorite shows
- Mark and brag about watched shows
- Mark shows you want to watch, but do not have the time at the moment
- You can see the favorite shows of your friends
